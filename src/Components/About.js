        My name's Poonam (she/her) - a full-stack developer and wearer of many
        hats. I believe tech should be people-first, equity-centred and
        sustainably focused.
        <br />
        <br /> I mentor people to become fully capable programmers from no
        coding experience. I believe in technology as a tool, humane software
        and healthy connections to the digital world.
